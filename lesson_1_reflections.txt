Because it done the most boring part in searching bug - scrolling through
the document.
I think that when you go through all your changes and mistakes you
can remember them and do not repeat them in future.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Your commits will have logic and it will be easier to choose the moment, when you will want to revert version.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because Git was designed as version control system for programmes. Google Doc, Dropbox, etc. were not.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log to see all the commits history with some notes and commit ids
git diff to compare commits using commit ids from the git log
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It is definitely can make me more brave in changes and experiements. 
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
For my projects in future iOS Development Udacity courses.
