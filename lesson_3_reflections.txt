When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
In order i can colloborate with another programmers.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Hmm, I'll be ok if if Git stay up-to-date with my GitHub.
