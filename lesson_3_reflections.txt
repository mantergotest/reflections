When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
In order i can colloborate with another programmers.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Hmm, I'll be ok if if Git stay up-to-date with my GitHub.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork - when you want to work on someones else project. 
Clone - to copy project with all commits.
Branch - to work on different features of one project, keeping current version safe.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Just to know what changes ur teammates done, when u offline.
